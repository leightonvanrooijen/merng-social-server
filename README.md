## Project Aim

The project's aim was to familirise myself with a the production stack MERNG (MongoDB, Express, React, Node, Graphql). I have experience with a MERN stack. However, I felt that the API could be more front end friendly for developers so I decided to add Graphql into the mix. Having a seperate backend was to make it so I could build a React and React Native front end without having to reuse any back end code.

This is the Express, Node, MongoDB backend of the project so we will focus on that. For the front end you can visit https://github.com/leightonvanrooijen/merng-social-client.
